## WorkBuddy 中国语境适配（优先）

本 skill 已转换为 WorkBuddy 中国语境版本。当前模块：**商事合同法务**；当前技能：**合同审查**。

在执行下方原流程前，先读取并遵守：

- `../../references/china-context.md`（本模块中国语境规则）
- `../../../references/china-legal-context.md`（全局中国法律语境总则）

除非用户明确指定其他法域，默认适用**中国大陆**。下方原文中的美国州法、Delaware、ABA、CourtListener、Westlaw、DMCA、NPRM、deposition、subpoena、attorney work product 等内容均视为原模板遗留项；遇到冲突时，以中国法、监管机关、司法/仲裁程序、团队 playbook 和本适配段为准。

输出默认使用简体中文。法律、法规、司法解释、监管规则、国家标准、案例或截止日不能确认现行有效时，标注 `[需核验]`，并给出应核验的官方来源或授权数据库。对外发送、正式提交、董事会/股东会文件、劳动解除、数据出境、监管回复、诉讼/仲裁文件等后果性动作，必须经过执业律师或法务负责人确认。

# /review

Reviews an inbound agreement against the playbook in `~/.workbuddy/skills/config/workbuddy-cn-legal/commercial-legal/CLAUDE.md`. Identifies the agreement structure from titles, selects the appropriate skill(s), and — if confirm_routing is enabled — checks with the user before proceeding.

## Instructions

1. **Load `~/.workbuddy/skills/config/workbuddy-cn-legal/commercial-legal/CLAUDE.md`.** If placeholders present, stop and prompt: "Run `/commercial-legal:cold-start-interview` first — I need to learn your playbook before I can review against it."

   Also read `~/.workbuddy/skills/config/workbuddy-cn-legal/commercial-legal/CLAUDE.md` → `## Review preferences` → `confirm_routing`. If the field is missing, treat it as `true`.

2. **Get the agreement:** From file path, Drive link, [CLM ID], or pasted text. If none provided, ask.

3. **Read the document structure — titles first.**

   Before reading the body, extract:
   - The main agreement title (e.g., "Master Services Agreement", "Non-Disclosure Agreement")
   - All exhibit, schedule, addendum, and attachment titles (e.g., "Exhibit A — Data Processing Addendum", "Schedule 1 — Subscription Order Form", "Annex B — Service Level Agreement")

   This is the routing signal. Do not rely on body keywords alone — a 40-page MSA with "confidential" throughout is not an NDA.

4. **Select the skill(s) based on document structure.**

   Map each identified document or section to a skill:

   | Document / section title contains | Skill |
   |---|---|
   | Non-Disclosure, NDA, Confidentiality Agreement (as the *main* agreement) | **nda-review** |
   | Master Services Agreement, Professional Services, Statement of Work, Consulting Agreement | **vendor-agreement-review** |
   | Subscription, SaaS, Cloud Services, Order Form with auto-renewal, Software License with recurring fees | **saas-msa-review** (overlay on vendor-agreement-review) |
   | Data Processing Addendum, DPA, Data Processing Agreement (as exhibit or standalone) | note for **vendor-agreement-review** → data protection section |
   | Service Level Agreement, SLA (as exhibit) | note for **saas-msa-review** → SLA section |

   Multiple skills may apply. Common combinations:
   - MSA + DPA exhibit → vendor-agreement-review, with DPA noted
   - SaaS subscription + Order Form + SLA exhibit → saas-msa-review (covers all three)
   - MSA + Order Form with auto-renewal → vendor-agreement-review + saas-msa-review overlay

   When the structure is genuinely ambiguous after reading titles (e.g., a document titled "Agreement" with no exhibits listed), read the first two pages of the body to resolve it — then stop and route.

5. **Confirm routing if enabled.**

   If `confirm_routing` is `true` in `~/.workbuddy/skills/config/workbuddy-cn-legal/commercial-legal/CLAUDE.md` (or field is absent):

   ```
   I'm going to review this as: [agreement type(s)].

   Documents identified:
   - [Main agreement title] → [skill]
   - [Exhibit A title] → [how it will be handled]
   - [Exhibit B title] → [how it will be handled]

   Sound right? (yes / no — or tell me what I got wrong)
   ```

   Wait for confirmation before proceeding. If the user corrects the routing, apply their instruction and proceed.

   If `confirm_routing` is `false`: proceed silently. Log the routing decision at the top of the review memo so the user can see what was applied.

6. **Run the skill(s).** Follow each skill's workflow fully. If multiple skills apply, run them in sequence and integrate the output into a single memo — don't produce separate memos.

7. **Check for escalations:** If any issue exceeds the reviewer's authority per the `~/.workbuddy/skills/config/workbuddy-cn-legal/commercial-legal/CLAUDE.md` matrix, invoke **escalation-flagger** to route and draft the ask.

8. **Offer follow-ups:**
   - Stakeholder summary for the business owner
   - Redline .docx with tracked changes
   - [CLM] record creation (if connected)
   - Add to renewal register (if auto-renewal found)

## Configuring confirm_routing

Add to `~/.workbuddy/skills/config/workbuddy-cn-legal/commercial-legal/CLAUDE.md` → `## Review preferences`:

```markdown
## Review preferences

confirm_routing: true   # Set to false to skip routing confirmation and proceed automatically
```

The cold-start interview should ask about this preference. Default is `true` — confirmation on. As trust builds, the user can set it to `false`.

## Examples

```
/commercial-legal:review vendor-msa.pdf
```

```
/commercial-legal:review https://drive.google.com/file/d/ABC123
```

```
/commercial-legal:review
[paste agreement text]
```

## Output

Full review memo per the skill's format. Routing decision logged at the top. Deviation-by-deviation, specific redline language, named approver. Saved where `~/.workbuddy/skills/config/workbuddy-cn-legal/commercial-legal/CLAUDE.md` → House style says work product goes.
